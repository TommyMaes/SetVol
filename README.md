# SetVol
A little program that allows to set a specific volume on every windows startup

Very simple and lightweight

Doesn't stay running in background, no systemtray icon or any notifications

Jut make sure to unpack before installing

I made it becouse i needed the function and could not find anything like this

Desided to make it a little more user friendly and share it online so others could enjoy



I have tested this on Windows 10 Home Ver. 21H1
