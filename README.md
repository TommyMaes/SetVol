# SetVol
A little program that allows to set a specific volume on windows startup

I made it becouse i needed the function and could not find anything like this

Desided to make it a little more user friendly and share it online so others could enjoy

I have tested this on Windows 10 Ver. 21H1

Please let me know if you have any issues or if you are missing a feature
